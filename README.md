# Tuberculosis Incidenceï¼ŒDeaths and Disability-Adjusted Life Years in Children and Adolescence, 1990-2021: Results From the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.


## Project Description
This project aims to visualize the burden of Tuberculosis (TB) among children and adolescents globally, using data from the 2021 Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD 2021). Our visualizations focus on TB incidence, mortality, and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) across different regions, ages, and genders from 1990 to 2021.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is derived from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021. It includes TB incidence, mortality, and DALYs for individuals aged 0 to 19 years in 204 countries and regions. The data are analyzed and visualized to provide insights into trends over time and disparities by geographic location and socio-demographic index (SDI).

## Features
- **Incidence Visualization**: Plots showing TB incidence rates globally and by region.
- **Mortality Analysis**: Charts detailing mortality rates, with a focus on multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).
- **DALYs Visualization**: Analysis of disability-adjusted life years by age and gender.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparisons between different demographic groups and over time to highlight significant trends.
